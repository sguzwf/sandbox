# python

for python3:

```shell
sudo apt-get install python3.4 python3-pip
```

## notes

exec\* functions execute a new program, replacing the current process; they do not return. On Unix, the new executable is loaded into the current process, and will have the same process id as the caller.

This is awesome! I'm wondering if node has something like this?

unfortunately, GitPython only works with python2.
